# SimpleMailrelay
README in Japanese is [here](README_JP.md)

# What is this?
A simple mail relay server built with Postfix and OpenDKIM. When you send mail to this container, it forwards the mail externally with a DKIM signature, depending on the sender domain. Supports multiple domains. The DKIM selector is fixed to `default`.

Docker Hub repository is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/netebakari/ubuntu-postfix-opendkim).

# Motivation
* I want a simple mail relay server and know how DKIM works.
* I want to keep logs of when, to whom, and what kind of emails were sent, as long as storage capacity allows.
* I want to output Postfix logs to standard output for easy handling.

# Environment Tested
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS + Docker 27.5.1

# Docker Hub
https://hub.docker.com/r/netebakari/simple-mail-relay


# Logs
## Postfix log
Since logs are output to standard output, you can check them with `docker logs` or `docker compose logs`.

## Mail logs
Two types of log files are output:
* CSV file summarizing the mail's timestamp, subject, and recipient in one line.
* Plain text file containing all information, including the mail header, body, attachment of single mail.


# How to Start
## 1. Create Mail Log Directories
```sh
$ mkdir -p logs/list
$ mkdir -p logs/raw
$ chmod 777 logs/list logs/raw
  or
$ chown YOUR-USER-WHOSE-ID-IS-1000 logs/list logs/raw
```

Mail logs are stored by the `maillog` user, whose user / group id is 1000:1000.

## 2. DKIM Configuration
### Create DKIM keys
```sh
$ mkdir keys
```

Create DKIM public/private keys using the `opendkim-genkey` command and put them into the `keys/` directory. You can store keys for multiple domains.

The filename should be in the format `FQDN + .private`, such as `example.com.private`.

### Register keys in your DNS
Register the public key in your DNS TXT record. Since DKIM is verified by the recipient, you can skip this step if you are just testing.

```
$ dig +short txt default._domainkey.example.com
"v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0...."
```

## 3. Start
Initially, all emails are forwarded to [mailcatcher](https://hub.docker.com/r/schickling/mailcatcher/). Don't worry, no mails will be sent externally!

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## 4. Send Test Email
### Send a mail
Now you can connect to port TCP/25 or TCP/1025 of localhost using TELNET or something you would like and send emails. If you write an email address of a domain with DKIM configuration completed in From, it will be signed.

```sh
$ telnet localhost 1025
HELO localhost
MAIL FROM: test@example.com
RCPT TO: someone@netebakari.local
DATA
From: test@example.com
To: someone@netebakari.local
Subject: Test
Hello World!
.
QUIT
```

### Check the mail logs
Check the email body by mailcatcher (working at [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080)) or log file in `/logs/raw/YYYY-MM-DD/`. It would be just like:

```

```

## 5. Postfix Configuration
### Change server name
Change the `SERVERNAME` environment variable in `compose.yaml` to the server's FQDN. It is highly recommended that this FQDN be reverse resolvable.

### Customize `transport` file
If you want this mail relay server to deliver mail **directly to the internet**, comment out the `/etc/postfix/transport` mount in `compose.yaml`. A `transport` file with the following content will be automatically generated and used:

```
localhost   local:
*           smtp:
```

If you would like forward mails to a specific server, create a Postfix [transport](https://www.postfix.org/transport.5.html)‚Å† file and mount it to `/etc/postfix/transport`. The `postmap` command is executed at start up time.

```
localhost   local:
*           smtp:[email-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com]:25
```

### Remove mailcatcher
Remove mailcathcer in `compose.yaml` if you don't need it.
